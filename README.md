# dmb-homebrew

### This repository is no longer active! ###

A collection of homebrew databases for [Diamond Mind Baseball](https://diamond-mind.com) converted to be compatible with the **version 11** game.

These files are stored here for the sole purpose of providing a reliable backup for the [Homebrew Season Repository](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fansofdmb/homebrewed-season-repository-t5397.html) located on the [Fans of Diamond Mind Baseball](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fansofdmb/) community forums.  Most of the these files are no longer available from the original source or are not in a format that is compatible with version 11 of the Diamond Mind Baseball game software.


### Installation Instructions:

The standard method of loading one of these homebrew files is to create a new database with the **File -> Create new empty database** command ( 1 ) and then use the **File -> Restore** command ( 2 ) to load the contents of the database backup file to the new database that you created.
